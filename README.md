# course-notebooks

**Note:** I have passed all the following courses. However, I have only four certificates of them. Due to the difference in the value of the U.S. Dollar and the Rial currency and the lack of existing eligible ways of paying directly for these courses, I was not able to enroll in all of them. Therefore, I found some ways (such as torrent) to download the courses and pass them on my local machine without having the chance of getting their certificate.

Here you will find my written notebooks from passing Udemy and Coursra courses.
